Hey buddies,

This is a small bash code which add exit in your .bashrc file. When we try to open the terminal, it will auto exit..

This is just for fun to make your friends panic, who are new to Linux OS.

You can open the ./bashrc file via your file manager by enabling hidden files.. 

Remove the exit line and save it to bring back normal...
